    // ...
    // Efficient memory usage to avoid system slowdowns or crashes
    // ...
}
```

7. Call the functions in the main program:
```cpp
int main() {
    vector<double> marketData; // Placeholder for market data
    vector<double> predictions; // Placeholder for predictions
    
    // Neural network learning
    neuralNetworkLearning(marketData);
    
    // User-friendly interface
    userInterface();
    
    // Execute orders based on predictions
    executeOrders(predictions);
    
    // Ensure compatibility with MT4 platform
    ensureCompatibility();
    
    // Optimize performance
    optimizePerformance();
    
    return 0;
}
```
